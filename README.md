# Smart Lighting System
This project can usually be at your gate as this realizes and switches on the light for you.
This project has a PIR sensor which senses for any movement nearby and hence sends a signal.
An LDR sensor is also been included so that when there is sufficient light nearby then switching On the light would not be required.
This even has an LCD Screen which prompts Welcome and shows the time and date using RTC module.
